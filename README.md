# Step 1: Clone Repository and Run all cells in notebook

# First part of the notebook gives initial looks at data tables and shows relationship between day and price on line graph

# Mitchell
# Second Part of the notebook produces visualiztions comparing Average Anual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Capita of US v. Average Anual Oil Prices (1987-2020) and Average Anual S&P 500 Closing Price v. Average Anual Oil Prices (1987-2018)

# Anna
# Third Part of the notebook creates an auto regression model and visualization for Monthly Oil prices from 1980-2018

# John
# Fourth Part of the notebook creates an initial SVC model for the Import Countries data set.  Then a PCA is ran and a "best fit" SVC model is created using the PCA parameters.

# Namith
# Fifth Part of the notebook uses the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process/Euler-Maruyama method to create a function (Euler_M) that simulates a stochastic differential equation that is used to model the movement of a particle in a fluid under the influence of friction.  Within the function, the user can specify how many times the simulation runs.  Averages out the simulated data and the resulting R-squared value.
